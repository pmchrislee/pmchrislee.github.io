//function declaration:
function myFunc(){
    console.log("myFunc");
}

//function call:
myFunc(); //logs "myFunc" to the console


function myFunc2(sayWhat){ //sayWhat is a special variable called an argument
    //equiv of var sayWhat = "Hello"; (or whatever is passed in as a parameter)
    console.log(sayWhat);
}

//inside the function declaration, the variable name used as an argument will be set to equal the parameter
//inside myFunc2, the equivalent of
//    var sayWhat = "Hello";
//is automatically applied

//logs "Hello"
myFunc2("Hello"); //the "Hello" in the parentheses is a parameter
myFunc2("Whatever"); //logs "Whatever"

function myFunc3(){
    return "Hi, there!";
}

console.log(   myFunc3()   ); //logs "Hi, there!"

//when you see a function call, you can think about replacing that call with the function's return value
console.log(   "Hi, there!"   ); //myFunc3() "resolves" to the string "Hi, there!"

console.log(   myFunc()   ); //myFunc() is called, logging "myFunc" but it has no explicit return value, so it resolves to "undefined"


//CHAINING:
//write a function that reverses a string:
function revStr(str){
    //argument str will equal whatever is submitted as a parameter
    //str.split("") creates an array (resolves to an array) of every character in str
    //str.split("").reverse() acts on the array and reverses it
    //str.split("").reverse().join("") acts on the reversed array and converts it back into a string
    //that reversed string is returned
    return str.split("").reverse().join(""); //ultimately revStr resolves to (returns) a string
}

//split (converts a string into an array):
console.log("test".split("")); //logs an array: ["t", "e", "s", "t"]
console.log("test".split("e")); //logs an array: ["t", "st"]
console.log("this is a test".split("s")); //logs an array: ["thi", " i", " a te", "t"];

//join (concatenates an array into a string):
console.log(["thi", " i", " a te", "t"].join("s")); //logs "this is a test"
console.log(["thi", " i", " a te", "t"].join("")); //logs "thi i a tet"

console.log(revStr("I love JavaScript!")); //"!tpircSavaJ evol I"


//SCOPE:
//every variable has a scope: it exists in one area and not in another
var myGlobal = "Hello"; //this is a global variable...it exists anywhere in the app

function myFunc4(){
    var myFunctionScopeVar = "Hi"; //this is a function scope variable...it exists ONLY inside the function (when the function ends, the variable is deleted)
}

console.log(myGlobal); //logs "Hello"
//console.log(myFunctionScopeVar); //logs undefined (it doesn't exist outside the function)

//to keep your entire app out of the global scope, one popular method is to enclose everyting in an immediately invoking function expression (IIFE):
(function(){
    
    //my app goes here
    var myVar = "Hello, again!"; //this is NOT GLOBAL; it exists only in the IIFE function scope
    
    //you still have access to everything in global scope:
    console.log(myGlobal);
    console.log(   revStr("I'm inside an IIFE!")   ); //the function is also in global scope
    
    //you can define an inner function that only exists inside the IIFE:
    function innerFunction(){
        console.log("I'm inside an IIFE!");
    }
    innerFunction();
    
})();

//outside the IIFE:
//console.log(myVar); //undefined
//innerFunction(); //"Uncaught ReferenceError: myFunctionScopeVar is not defined": there is no function of this name in global scope

//CLOSURE:
//inner functions can access variables defined within the outer function, but not vice versa
function getNext(){
    var nextNumber = 0;
    
    //return an inner function that has access to nextNumber:
    return function(){
        nextNumber++;
        return nextNumber;
    }
}

var next = getNext(); //next now equals that inner function
console.log(next()); //1
console.log(next()); //2
console.log(next()); //3 ...
